    <h2>Beginning Your First Assignment</h2>
    
    

<p>As per the basic description on canvas, it is a good idea to include sketches and examples of previous work that inspired/influenced you. You need to explain what your site will look like, what it means, why you want to make it, how you will make it, and who has informed your ideas and approach. </p>

<p>In terms of the website itself, it does not have to be a functional commercial website, although if you have your heart set on it, you may. Think of your website as a proof of concept where the basic programming tools we are learning are the method of presenting the material/ideas/visual experience you are exploring. Your website may even be <i>about</i> these tools themselves.</p>

<p>Here are some ideas to get you thinking: You may wish to explore the formal qualities of html through experimenting with its default characteristics. What sort of experience does an overwhelming array of hyperlinks produce? Can you create a visual representation of a computational abstractions such as the cloud? </p>

<p>You may wish to create an abstract and/or purely aesthetic experience. How might you simulate death and reincarnation in the browser? How would you show how deep the ocean is? What would it mean to lucid dream inside the browser?—<i><b>your imagination is the only limit!</i></b> <a href="https://www.are.na/ian-mcdonald/an-idea-for-a-website">Here</a> is a list of ideas to get you started. You will be marked on how your website and the experience it creates brings your ideas to life through an interactive experience, and how appropriately you have used the programming languages we will cover to do so. </p>
    
    

<p>This course will involve self-directed learning and research that is contingent upon on your specific idea and approach. It is not possible to teach or learn every single tag and attribute, and so you will need to go beyond what is taught in class to realise your projects. Getting in the habit of doing this research using freely available resources is a valuable skill, and is part of what you will learn. Today and over the next few weeks we will be using the <a href=" https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3</a> web tutorials, for instance.
    Do not be discouraged if it takes hard work to realise your idea; I will advise you if I think it is not achievable in the time we have available.</p>

<p>Note that programming is often difficult and time consuming—there will likely be moments in this course where you may feel frustrated or struggle to join the dots. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT THIS— together, and in some cases on your own, we can usually find out what we need to complete our assignments. </p>
   
    

    
    <h2>Principles and Elements of Art and Design</h2>
    
    <h3>Elements</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Line</li>
        <li>Shape</li>
        <li>Forms</li>
        <li>Space</li>
        <li>Colour</li>
        <li>Texture</li>

    </ul>
    
    <p>See <a href="https://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/formal_analysis.html">this</a> page for a more detailed breakdown of these elements and how you might use them to think about the design of your page. A pdf with definitions is also available in the module for week 1. It helps to look at a few examples of websites and try to use these elements to upack how these elements construct the experience of viewing and/or using it. </p>
    
    
    <h3>Principles</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Balance</li>
        <li>Emphasis</li>
        <li>Movement</li>
        <li>Pattern</li>
        <li>Repetition</li>
        <li>Proportion/Scale</li>
        <li>Rhythm</li>
        <li>Variety</li>
        <li>Unity</li>
    </ul>
    
     <p>Likewise see <a href="https://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/formal_analysis2.html#balance">this</a> page for a more detailed breakdown of how you might use some of these principles to think about the design of your page. A pdf is also available in the module for week 1.</p>
    
    
        <h2>Examples & Inspiration</h2>

    
    <p>I have compiled a series of examples and broken them down into categories, with the intention of providing some scope and inspiration to get you thinking about the kind of website you might like to make.</p>
    
    
    
   <h3>Brutalist Websites</h3>

<p>There have been many trends in web-design, a relatively recent trend was for 'brutalist' websites (a term with its origins in modernist architecture). The use of this modernist term is instructive in that brutalist websites are brutally functional in the manner of, say, a Le Corbusier building, or perhaps a soviet apartment block. Form follows function, they are unadorned, they make use of only a bare minimum of materials, and so on. Brutalist websites often involve the unadulterated use, or even celebration, of the generic aesthetics of html itself—this site you are looking at now is an example of this design ethos. Think of geocities, craigslist, or some of these other examples below. As you can see below, Pascal Deville who coined the term clearly thinks the trend has passed!</p> 
    
    <img src="images/brutal.jpg">
    
     <ul>
        <li>A <a href="https://brutalistwebsites.com/">list</a> of brutalist websites. Have a browse if formalist design interests you.</li>
         <li>A <a href="https://brutalist-web.design/">list</a> of rules for making brutalist websites.</li>
        <li>An <a href="https://that1archive.neocities.org/">archive</a> of government documents made with neocities.</li>
         <li>A brutalist website for an <a href="http://takeawalkonthewildside.rietveldacademie.nl/">academic conference.</a> </li>
          
       
    </ul>
    
     
<h3>Single Use Websites</h3>

<p>There is an interesting genre of site often referred to as 'single use websites'. They are often strange, or a bit weird/ humorous, but can also be functional or interactive in a very specific way. You will notice that many internet artworks are essentially single use websites without a coherent or practical 'use'. What ideas do you have for an interesting single use website?</p>  
    
        <img src="images/space.jpg">

    
     <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.howmanypeopleareinspacerightnow.com/">See</a> how many people are in space right now.</li>
         <li>Find <a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/">out</a> how secure your password is.</li>
        <li>See all <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/48.37,-12.34/5">flights</a> currently in the air. Perhaps not technically single use but you get the idea.</li>
         <li><a href="https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html">This</a> site gives us a to-scale representation of the solar-system if the moon was the size of a single pixel</li>
         <li>Single use websites <a href="https://isitchristmas.com/">can be a bit silly.</a> </li>
         
          
       
    </ul>


    <h3>Internet art/Net.art</h3>

<p>There is a canon of interesting art that is both <i>of</i> and <i>about</i> the architecture of the web—in both an aesthetic and a philosophical sense. Art that uses the formal and technical constraints of the internet as its medium has a partiular history. You're highly encouraged to look through <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/">this</a> site and get a sense of this lineage. An interview with some of the key practitioners can be found<a href="
    https://www.spikeartmagazine.com/en/articles/netart"> here.</a> A more critical historical appraisal can be found <a href="
     http://www.zerodeux.fr/en/essays-en/the-polyphonic-history-of-net-art-an-eternal-network-%EF%BB%BF/">here</a>.
    
    
  
    
    </p>


<p>There is too much to summarise here but we will look at a few seminal examples from the early period of internet art, often referred to as the 'net.art' period.</p>
    
    <img src="images/shulgin1.jpg">
    
     <ul>
        <li>Russian artist Alexei Shulgin's <a href="http://archive.rhizome.org/artbase/48528/">Form Art</a> is a seminal piece of net.art. Open it and have a play. Read more about it <a href="https://anthology.rhizome.org/form-art">here.</a></li>
         <li>He is also well known for his curatorial project <a href="http://www.easylife.org/desktop/">Desktop Is</a> which explored the desktop as a site of life, work and play.</li>
        
    </ul>
   
    <img src="images/shulgin2.jpg">

<p>You will notice that some if these works look 'old'. Shulgin's work is a good example of this; in the two images above you can see the work as it first appeared in 1997 via the Netscape browser, and how it appears today adapted to current browsers. Changes in screen resolution, the design of browsers and hardware and so on make it look quite different, although the code and underlying architecture is the same. What this reveals is that the fundamental architecture of the internet has not changed since Tim Berners Lee invented Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (http) and HTML (hyper text mark up language) in 1989. A website made back then can be viewed in more or less the same way now (although differences in browsers may prevent this). </p>

<p> Although there have been numerous design trends, and alternative web-authoring software has come and gone (flash for instance), the basis of almost all webpages remains HTML, CSS and Javascript. We are here to learn about this fundamental underlying architecture. We are learning to use these three fundamental coding languages, so that in the future you will be able to apply them to your own web-based work and projects. In order to do this, we will create a website that is formally and conceptually engaging, and that contains interactive elements. I am not expecting you to produce websites that appear 'advanced', 'professional' or commercially viable (of course if that is important to you that is okay too, but it is not our core concern). </p>

     <ul>
        <li>JODI are another important example you will come across if you research net.art. Their <a href="http://404.jodi.org/ae/">website</a> is in and of itself an interesting work. Read about their IDN series of works <a href="https://www.e-flux.com/journal/74/59810/jodi-s-infrastructure/">here.</a></li>
         
         
         
         
         
         <li>Their <a href="http://idn.jodi.org/">IDN</a> works use the formalist architecture of the web and the 'refresh' command to create endless loops. See one of them <a href="http://xn--jp7aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.xn--jp7a.com/">here.</a> You can see the source code for this site below. Indeed, you can right click and 'view source' on almost any page.</li>
        
    </ul>
    

        <img src="images/jodi.jpg">

    
    
    
    <h3>Narrative Approaches</h3>

<p>The narrative possibilities suggested by hyperlinks have been used by many artists and designers to construct interactive websites. The 'choose your own adventure' style website is a common trope. What can you do with it? What kind of story can you tell?</p>
    
         <img src="images/anna.jpg">


    <ul>
        <li>Olia Lialina is another well know internet artist who's work takes narrative form. This <a href="http://www.teleportacia.org/war/wara.htm">work</a> presents the user with a seemingly endless series of narrative options. </li>
         
         
         <li>Anna Anthropy's work <a href="https://w.itch.io/end-of-the-world/">Queers at the end of the World</a> uses similar formal devices, but incorporates interactive elements to keep the user moving and simulate some of the anxiety and tension relationships sometimes induce.</li>
        
    </ul>



    
 <h3> Visual approaches </h3>

<p> Some of you may wish to use the medium in a manner that is explicitly visual. Making images with HTML and CSS can be painstaking, but also very rewarding and a lot of fun. Some of these examples come from the world of designers and enthusiasts, and some of them are made by artists. See examples below and also open up the source code to see how these sites/artworks are built. </p>

      <img src="images/asendorf.jpg">
    
     <ul>
        <li>Artist Kim Asendorf makes works using CSS gradients and colours. See her website for more <a href="http://kimasendorf.com/css-compositions/">examples.</a> See the source code for one of these images <a href="http://kimasendorf.com/css-compositions/no-content-but-rich/1415138015672.css
">here.</a>
         
         
         </ul>
    
           <img src="images/diana.png"> 
         
         <ul>

         
         
         <li>Designer Diana Smith has made highly detailed portraits and classical images using only HTML and CSS. Let's watch a video about her process <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kgx7p/painting-made-with-code-html-pure-css-browser-art-diana-smith">here.</a> As you can see below, opening the image in a different browser, or changing the precise css attributes transforms the image - later on we will learn to make attributes dynamic using Javascript. Download and view the source code for one of her images <a href="https://github.com/cyanharlow/purecss-vignes">here.</a> </li>
        
    </ul>
    
     <img src="images/diana2.png">



 <ul>

                
         <li><a href="https://www.cameronsworld.net/">Cameron's World</a> is an interactive website devoted to the nostalgic aesthetics of late 90s internet, such as 'fantasy world' below. Scroll down and see a sections devoted to different genres and styles. View source to look at Cameron's code.</li>
        
    </ul>

     <img src="images/cameron.png">
    
    
 <ul>

                
         <li>Rafael Rozendaal is a well known visual artist who has made over 100 simple websites. Some are interactive, some are not. Look at some examples <a href="http://intotime.com/">here</a>,<a href="http://deepsadness.com/"> here,</a><a href="http://www.fillthisup.com/"> here</a>, <a href="http://www.fallingfalling.com/"> here</a>. Have a look at another of Rozendaal's works titled <a href="http://www.abstractbrowsing.net/">Abstract Browsing</a> in which he created a chrome add-on that creates abstract images based on browsing habits. He turned these images into tapestries. </li>
        
    </ul>

  <h3>Informational/practical approaches</h3> 

<p> If you really want to make your website your portfolio or a website for your favourite cafe, you may, but let's apply the same consideration in terms of aesthetics and the concepts it can carry. Here are some artists websites/portfolios that are interesting for their highly specific references, their 'anti-aesthetic', or because they are well designed for their purpose. </p>
    
    
<ul>

                
         <li>Artist Amalia Ulman's <a href="https://amaliaulman.eu/"> personal website </a>is a good example of a brutalist design, that speaks to the concerns of her broader art practice</li>
    <li>Artist/musician Fatima al Qadiri's <a href="http://fatimaalqadiri.com/"> personal website </a>is also a good example in that her work is broadly interested in default aesthetics.</li>
     <li><a href="http://nipponcolors.com/#shironezumi">This </a> excellent website enables viewers to browse, preview, and gain colour codes from traditional Japanese colours. </li>
     <li><a href="http://www.marianopascual.me/#">This </a>portfolio site makes good use of simple Javascript to add interactive elements. </li>
    <li><a href="https://hawraf.com/">Here </a>is another portfolio site for a design agency, it also makes good use of simple Javascript to add interactive elements, and has a playful, brutalist aesthetic. </li>
        
    </ul>
