        <h2>Malnutrition is one of the greatest health challenges that is faced globally.</h2>
          <p>It is a leading cause of death around the world. According to World Health Organisation (WHO) (2020), "1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese, while 462 million are underweight", whilst "45% of deaths amongst children under 5 years of age" are attributed to malnutrition. Malnutrition includes: undernutrition i.e. wasting (low weight-for-height), stunting (low height-for-age), underweight (low weight-for-age), excess or lack of essential nutrients, and overweight/obesity, which is linked with diet-related diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes etc (WHO, 2020). Malnutrition is an issue that faced by all countries and individuals of all income levels. Countries are facing issues of obesity and undernutrition simultaneously. It impacts the economy, health care system, productivity and of course, health. Nutrition needs to be made a priority, thorugh better education, universal accessibility to healthy diets and effective nutrient interventions, nutrition can be improved to better sustain the health of individuals within society.<p>

            <h2>HOW MUCH FOOD IS AVAILABLE PER PERSON?</h2>
            <p>The following chart represents the availability of food for consumption at a retail level. It captures the daily average supply of calories (kilocalories - kcal) that are available per person according to continent, rather than the actual consumption. On a global scale, the daily average supply of food person has been progressively increasing. However, this varies across the continents. Africa and Asia show a large increase in supply, in contrast Europe, Australia and New Zealand have remained constant across nearly 60 years, with slight fluctuations. From 1990, onwards it can be seen that the regions are converging, in comparison to 1961, the gap has lessened greatly between the Western World and Eastern World.  </p>

                <p>The maps above show the prevalence of overweight or obese adults (18 years or older) and children (2-4 years of age) respectively, around the world in 2016. In both charts, a correlation can be seen between prosperity and the prevalence of overweight individuals. The United States has the highest prevalence of overweight adults with roughly 70% of the population overweight. In contrast, 20% of the populations in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia are overweight. However, the prevalence of overweight or obese children is the highest, with more than 40% in Saudi Arabia, followed by Chile. In comparison to adults, prevalence of obesity and overweightness in children sweeps across many more countries, with roughly 1 in 4 or 5 children (2-4 years of age) considered to be overweight.  </p>

            <h2>HOW MUCH DEATH IS ATTRIBUTED TO OBESITY OR OVERWEIGHTNESS?</h2>
            <p>The share of deaths caused by obesity can be seen across countries. On a global scale, roughly 8% of deaths can be attributed to obesity in 2017, which is an increase from 5% in 1990. Across the world this percentage varies, with North America having the highest average of deaths (14%) caused by obesity, followed by Europe (13%). Whilst, Africa has the lowest average with roughly 5%, close to the global share of deaths caused by obesity in 1990. Asia is shows, along with South America, displays a large increase in deaths caused by obesity.</p>

            <h2>WHAT ABOUT UNDERNOURISHED INDIVIDUALS?</h2>
            <p>This chart displays the total number of individuals worldwide that are considered undernourished.  Undernourished individuals are those that consume an insufficient amount of nutrients, lower than the required amounts. Globally the population of undernourished individuals has fallen. The total fluctuates, where overall the number has gradually dropped. However, a slight increase can be seen from 2014 onwards, with 821 million in 2017, roughly a 50 million increase.</p>

            <h2>DOES INCOME LEVEL IMPACT THE PREVALENCE OF UNDERNOURISHED CHILDREN?</h2>
            <p>A correlation is often made between income levels and prosperity with malnutrition, this chart represents the prevalence of underweight children (younger than 5 years of age) based on income levels. The average prevalence, depending on each of the income levels over the years has decreased greatly since 1990, whilst households pertaining to high income shows little to no change, maintaining the lowest prevalence of underweight children. The chart shows households with income levels below the upper middle income level tend to have the higher prevalence of undernourished children. </p>

            <h2>GLOBALLY, ARE WE MAKING PROGRESS?</h2>
            <p>Global nutrition targets are essential to prioritising and monitoring areas that require action and improvement. Based on 194 countries, the chart shows the number of countries progressing on working towards meeting global nutrition targets in 2018. Less than 50 countries are 'on course' to meeting global nutrition targets in areas of child malnutrition (overweight, stunting, wasting), diabetes and exclusive breastfeeding (where infants receive only breast milk, no other liquids or solids (WHO, 2013)). Whilst, more than 150 have made no progress in meeting nutrition targets, or are worsening. </p>
